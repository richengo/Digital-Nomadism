rock remote working remote working arrived around however majority people still worked fixed location got hit coronavirus pandemic whist personally goal freedom work wherever choose year goal attained couple year back realised vast majority people transition remote struggle remote working lot benefit however certain condition nuance needed ensure get ensure productive whilst fighting feeling isolation loneliness seasoned remote worker got tip follow ensure make freedom work please tip space first one important tip ensuring got right space order best work whilst sitting lounge tv background may worked day home friday conducive high productivity undisturbed work planning remote long haul arrange space look like personal preference like work desk however lounge chair sofa coffee table standing desk floor viable option important space exclusive cut distraction also important separation away room may eat sleep relax firstly separate space hopefully mean free distraction work kitchen table could get distracted pile dirty dish people making food eating work lounge front tv separation work time non work time time lounge work away work fully present whatever spending time family catching latest netflix series bedroom probably people swear work perfectly well whilst lying bed however recommendation would keep bedroom sleeping keeping work technology far away possible healthy mind finally work space always home would recommend dedicated work space home however working remotely equal working home space could shared office space like wework could garden could quiet bench park remote beach beauty remote work remote done anywhere within reason modern technology allows u hotspot g soon g get high speed internet wide variety place time writing summer found beautiful common surrounded wood cricket pitch perfect place work morning heading back home lunch sun get hot tip plan tip actually unique remote working benefit much office however much easier get distracted procrastinate working remotely planning day creating structure work essential beauty remote work many case save lot time commuting make sure use time wisely personally used read commute commuted quite bit would get quite book month year moved remote missed reading suddenly time read obviously ridiculous though since time still taken task planning day crucial time get filled non essential enjoyed reading commute build reading day flexible maybe start work earlier since longer commute great schedule hour reading lunch finish day early lunch personally schedule day minute block larger task take time box together multiple block crucial plan entire day add lunch add break add phone call make mum add time relax stick every day ok task sometimes take longer get cut away altogether purpose exercise visually map day look like create mental timeline task need working task pipeline also get better understanding much fit day nice prompt help planning every morning ask question gt one thing everything else easier unnecessary tip move believe working remotely become healthier empowered use time choose however dark side choose work home got nice space set home suggested tip may end spending whole day place without form movement activity personally definitely guilty walk office plan day get work know missed lunch even stood desk please fall trap movement crucial physical mental wellbeing human evolved move daily movement practice critical ensure stay good health movement entirely however best multiple small session day rather one big session example may main workout morning start day work could add short walk lunch walking amazing everyone strive least minute walking daily might get stretch maybe min mobility stretching every hour could take phone call standing walking around could get standing desk tripod put laptop matter movement long every hour get move minute body thank mind tip socialise working remotely lonely enjoy bit water cooler banter office nice sit people coffee break need abandon working remotely live age technology many way get touch people get quite depressing sat working hour straight every day make sure socialise need long need zoom call every hour colleague need limit fellow co worker slack pick phone call family text best friend play game mate via app word friend could facetime whatsapp video app whomever maybe work remotely friend loved one family need social butterfly every day human social animal bit contact outside world help tip hard stop finally working remotely apps device really hard switch like got slack gmail trello intercom variety apps programme interact work synced laptop tablet phone impossible get away work notification even trying relax way go leave work device work space completely separating use disturb mode device work related stuff trying relax switch notification work apps since check apps regularly working anyway disturb cause unnecessary stress anxiety spending time loved finally could delete apps personal device use exclusively work device many way essential ensure even see sort work notification popping spending time away work nothing worse putting strain relationship present spending time instead keep getting caught putting fire work conclusion working remotely empowering amazing highly recommend anyone since really improve standard living work life balance need go smartly though ensure right check place right set ensure excel either get distracted outside force end overworked never switch finally fun creative work outside work outside garden go park read problem build

scale service business k year pricing strategy amp closing part iii iii pricing funny thing especially world motive make money driven able travel common mistake see work travel arena revolve around thinking living expense go okay income dive think make lot sense even living somewhere month go long way never really going comfortable bracket even cost living generally cheap lot additional expense flying somewhere like thailand back west pricey insurance year round another additional cost wherever also need pay decent lifestyle could two three time local pay quite easily good habit like putting money long term saving emergency fund investment also mandatory people low balling really sustainable would say good number shoot one happy pretty much city starting point number let say every month need one client nothing groundbreaking something need look considering charge part talked solving something instead selling something key getting deal also price long time hell bent trading time hourly fee know plenty people struggle stray away model paramount importance degree particular strategy inefficient client pay u outcome deliver long take u make happen fairly common story marketing world guy walk dentist raging toothache keeping agony day begs dentist take dentist say okay minute guy reply minute insane dentist say well happy take long one suffering unnecessarily little persuasion guy pretty happy hand minute work mention kind engraved everyone hour work make true employee level big bad world paid accordingly value bring marketplace let whether something take minute day influence pricing much freelance web designer could knock page website start could redo mine could redo one someone vastly successful k time wise going take le week expertise outcome making money change hand different rate need think transformation hiring going worth individual business personally think lot money bearing whether somebody else charging month spend couple hour week managing social medium think great nobody would go month seems overpriced rethink someone employee month house fuck month someone else come may absolute steal another example k month business would massive outlay one know article email landing page k could drop ocean sent email done sale sent one done take near enough time lucky get one unlucky get le rule pricing value deliver need exceed price person selling need decide price make brainer least attractive proposition client workout many people need every month make money definitely difficult find one two high paying client every month find lower paying one right strategy ever afraid ask money worth additional investment someone okay talking exclusively b higher value transaction though lot saying work c well real way round actual interaction people world mean talking phone guess local agency something closing client area work fine use step close get call someone first time put situation feel like going pitched first call min max outreach kind usually email end goal get someone minute chat state nothing sale today basically get idea somebody another reason like way opposed close call system get lot information prospect actually offer anything min free say good luck business think anything right say let book another day next hour discus simple term limit time waste people qualified afford see value continue thing min qualified prospect get nd call knowing struggling think need set completely different tone call way go straight serious call take help price approach lead warmed lot reach seen genius twitter clicked one ad kind warm kind script information like get feel min call would probably fit everyone follows think think kind revenue afford anything trivial ask discus mass past work success give crux basically offer tell found whatever either say goodbye think someone fit invite back early stage probably feel inclined speak everyone twice fine even though close rate low get lot information market dealing said patience wear thin fast naturally establish quality control second call frame sale pitch beginning end going ultimately decide well still best way seen describe come form analogy actually great way frame position area life walk folk house seen black labrador month go absolutely nut start tearing chase keep running running way however opposite decide run way start chasing reason many freelancer consultant software service name struggle attract client always one chasing pitch basically great stuff example work let talk work deal work sometimes desirable instead pitch go something like tell business see way help suddenly client chasing going tell current struggle working hour day seem find right person give job going present solution convince worth time successful people employ strategy often result end waiting list go month month appeal client number reason start wanting necessarily back good month two bad month freelancer find tirelessly convincing people needed special rate paid today make available tomorrow work really tight deadline needed result said good month followed two bad one second sale call first one way need high pressure inviting someone discus issue highlighting issue costing presenting solution quality prospect pretty much thing standing new client paying minute time quashing objection one chasing client going fucking headache going creating reason get seemingly thin air client chasing objection usually squashed easily already spent first min call listening facing continual battle decide take action need speak business partner yes absolutely need urgent sure afford afford based told seem way start next month well take handful client every quarter take month problem still may booked speak another one client successful mean guaranteed work get better phone really good script better result human taking conversation direction go without sort forcing issue really substitute understanding market talking like someone know shit though brings onto final point credibility something believe massively get way people moving onto bigger better thing often get caught thinking reputation xyz never worked space breakthrough valid issue thing everyone name one point someone zero track record success story behind give credibility way entering new market easiest way phone talk like know industry inside people know industry inside really phased done vast difference say post like one someone live breathe working online space think case credibility coming talk done though track record well even better also adapt linkedin website facebook whatever demonstrate even authority one business facebook group odd member get lot credibility authority people see u founder expert created community also take success story testimonial client area transfer well find people say hired best experience life work think maybe unpopular comment element fake till make new venture mean incredibly deceitful unethical mean someone deliver result probably going tell good story early right final couple thing think important week year book pick amazon unsexy subject productivity game changer someone want better way structure business venture travel da bomb basically break entire year day cycle mentally day hit one year goal basically give year work every year example goal let say double income last year visit iceland morocco year week hit goal every time negative day able evaluate hitting rather getting september time realizing dragged heel also like take week fucking seriously work hard create product mess around traffic funnel sale call week le serious stuff tweak campaign take odd new client surf travel running tight ship nomading much game discipline anything else keep top shit get stagnant look health money build everything around life year burning country year probably behind lifestyle really anyway like like surfing like sunshine rather travel end live somewhere like normal person travel feel
