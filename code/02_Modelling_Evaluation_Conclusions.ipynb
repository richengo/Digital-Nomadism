    "\n",
    "To keep up with current trends, companies, especially start-ups, are more willing to employ digital nomads to be part of their workforce. However, organisations are also worried about the mental stability of their potential employees and the risk of poor work quality. As part of the data scientist team in a recruitment agency, we want to understand the demographic of digital nomads and whether there is truly a correlation between the nomadic lifestyle and people who do not have relationship. We want to develop a classification model that could identify traits between digital nomads and people who are not in a relationship using Natural Language Processing. Essentially, what we want to know is, are freedom and love mutually exclusive?"

    "## Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This project explores data collected from two subreddits using Reddit's API, namely '[digitalnomad](https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/)' and '[marriagefree](https://www.reddit.com/r/marriagefree/)'. We focus on analyzing the textual content posted by each Reddit user, together with the titles of the posts, using Natural Language Processing techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data was found to be relatively clean since the Reddit platform enables us to scrape the data in a *.json* format. However, since we are extracting only the title and main content of each post, we had to drop many duplicates which resulted in an imbalanced number of posts between the two subreddits. The average length of posts for each subreddit was quite similar, about 115-131 words. \n",
    "\n",
    "Preprocessing was done by removing common stopwords within the `nltk` library and the remaining words were lemmatized. Looking at the top frequently occurring words in each subreddit, we found that people in 'digitalnomad' were often discussing about work and travel while people in 'marriagefree' were often discussing about relationships and life.\n",
    "\n",
    "While developing the classifier model, we built several pipelines, each containing a vectorizer and a classification model. We tuned the models' hyperparameters to obtain the best cross-validated score for each pipeline. Comparing the cross-validated scores, which give an estimate of the model's accuracy on unseen data, the best model was found to be a Multinomial Naive Bayes model. Since the hold-out method was also adopted, we could compare acuracy scores between train and test(hold-out) data, which were 0.98 and 0.97 respectively. Although it indicated slight overfitting of the data, the small difference was acceptable by our means. The high accuracy scores also suggest that digital nomads and single/unmarried people are very distinguishable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The prominent words which the Naive Bayes model used to classify the textual data into 'digitalnomad' posts are words relating to travel, countries, and accomodation while posts with words relating to relationships, family, and disharmony. Incidentally, the posts that the model misclassified under the 'digitalnomad' subreddit have words that are more related to finance while posts that are misclassified under the 'marriagefree' subreddit have words relating to family or females. We also observed that words like 'depressing' appeared over more than one post that were misclassified under the 'digitalnomal' subreddit. This may suggest some sort of correlation between distress and digital nomadism.\n",

    "**Observations:**  \n",
    "From the above, we are able to observe the following things:  \n",
    "1. **Cross-validated score** - The CV scores of all the tuned models using `GridSearchCV`. This simulates the estimated accuracy of each model on unseen data. Ideally, we want to pick the model with the highest CV score (closest to 1.0).\n",
    "2. **Precision** - The precision is the ability of the classifier to not label a negative sample as positive. The higher the precision, the better the classifier model is at positive samples correctly.\n",
    "3. **Recall** - The recall is the ability of the classifier to find all the positive samples. The higher the recall, the higher the proportion of correctly predicted positive samples.\n",
    "4. **F1-Score** - The F1 score is the weighted average of the precision and recall, where it reaches its best value at 1 and worst score at 0. The relative contribution of precision and recall to the F1 score are equal. The higher the F1 score, the better the classifier is.\n",
    "5. **ROC-AUC curve** - The ROC-AUC curves of all the tuned models. We can observe the relationship between the True Positive Rate (a.k.a. sensitivity or recall) and the False Positive Rate (a.k.a. specificity). Ideally, we want to pick the model with the highest ROC AUC (closest to 1.0), where the positive and negative classes are most separated.\n",
    "6. **Confusion matrix** - The confusion matrix of all the tuned models, where we can observe the number of True/False Positives and True/False Negatives. In this case, we want to choose a model where it can best reduce the total number of incorrect predictions, in other words the least number of False Positives and False Negatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "By observing the above, we see that all of the models performed better than the baseline prediction. Of which, the model best optimized on the various scoring metrics is the **Naive Bayes model**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Naive Bayes Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This classifier works on the principle of conditional probability, as given by the Bayes theorem. For each token, it calculates the conditional probability of that token given each class. This is done for every token and both classes to make a prediction. It assumes that the features are independent of one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of Naive Bayes include:\n",
    "- It is simple and easy to implement.\n",
    "- It doesn’t require as much training data.\n",
    "- It is highly scalable with the number of predictors and data points. This means that it works well in cases such as text classification.\n",
    "- It is not sensitive to irrelevant features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Caveats of Naive Bayes include:  \n",
    "- In real life, it is almost impossible to find a set of predictors which are completely independent. This would violate the assumption of feature independency.\n",
    "- It would not be able to make a prediction on unseen data that if a categorical variable has a category in test data set, which was not observed in training data set. This is often known as Zero Frequency. In spite of that, this issue could be solved by using smoothing techniques such as Laplace estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hyperparameters Extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to extract the hyperparameters selected by `GridSearchCV` for the selected model and re-fit the model to be used for validation. The reason for doing this is because the cross-validation trained the model using 4 out of 5 folds of data, we want to train the model again using the full training dataset."

    "**Observations:**  \n",
    "In general, the posts that are misclassified into subreddit 2 (marriagefree) have elements or words relating to family or females (such as 'woman', 'kid', 'child'), and the posts that are misclassified into subreddit 1 (digitalnomad) have elements or words that are more related to finance (such as 'insurance', 'money', 'tax'). It seems like people in the 'digitalnomad' community are more frequently discussing about their financial stability more so than about their families because of their lifestyles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Posts misclassified under the 'digitalnomad' community tend to have less words as seen above, and most of which seem almost random. Interestingly, there are several occurrences of words like 'depressing' which comes across as a negative emotional feeling more likely to be classified under the 'marriagefree' community as with what the model did. This may suggest that people within the 'digitalnomad' community may also have discussions about the negative emotions which they have while leading their nomadic lifestyles."

    "Through this project, we gained many useful insights about the discussions among people within the 'digitalnomad' and 'marriagefree' subreddits. Using the lemmatized textual data scraped from Reddit's API, we were able to develop a Multinomial Naive Bayes model with tuned hyperparameters to classify the users' posts into the two subreddits. In the process of constructing the model, we learnt that digital nomads and single/unmarried people talk about very different things. This may mean that freedom in digital nomadism and love are mutually exclusive and companies looking to recruit digital nomads should not be too worried about the mental instability caused by the loss of a relationship or the lack thereof. Despite that, this project is limited to analyzing data collected from two subreddit communities and it may not be sufficient to make such a bold claim.\n",
    "\n",
    "The classification model which we developed had a high accuracy score of 0.98, performing much better than the baseline score of 0.85. The model classified data into 'digitalnomad' posts using words relating to travel, countries, and accomodation and classified data into 'marriagefree' posts using words relating to relationships, family, and disharmony. 3% of the test values are predicted incorrectly, which comprises of 6 False Positives and 16 False Negatives (posts originating from the 'marriagefree' subreddit considered as positive class). Posts misclassified under the 'digitalnomad' subreddit have words relating to finance while posts misclassified under the 'marriagefree' subreddit have words relating to family or females.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further studies could be done if we were to analyze more discussions from other social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, Youtube, on digital nomadism. From these discussions we could continue to discover other traits and characteristics about people who decided to live the nomadic lifestyle. It is also possible to develop a survey targeted at digital nomads to obtain more information about their demographics. With deeper understanding, we would be able to provide better professional advice to organizations looking to employ digital nomads, and boosting reputation as a recruitment agency."
